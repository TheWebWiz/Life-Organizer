# Life Organizer

## Updates

### Update 1

HTML and CSS has been created for the ToDo List! The app should be viewed on mobile or smaller screens for the best view, but will scale to any size screen! All pages where vailidated and approved thru W3C as well, and was tested on multiple browsers. There is no functionality to the app currently(other than navigation), but hopefully by the end of this weekend the app will be 100% functional and built with react! I decided to make the app more complex in some areas, and I believe react is the perfect tool for the job! For now, I hope you enjoy the styles of the soon to be finished ToDo page.

## Description

Life Organizer is a mobile web app that I currently have in development. This application is designed to solve a few inconveniences I have with my current management apps. I wanted to create something that would contain all the information I use for task tracking in programming and development, as well as my business checkbook and noteboard. The app will be released in steps that you can see by going to the milestones sections of this GitHub repository. If you have any questions or would like to contact me please do so at thewebwizard@outlook.com.

## Features(In order to be released)

### 1.ToDo List

The ToDo list will be a simple forum submission and saving page. Its main goal will be saving text the user inputs, then removing the items as they are checked off. Future iterations will include dates for when the items should be completed by.

### 2.Notes

The Notes page will be a stacked documents page that allows the user to save long form notes for review and editing later. These notes will be a standard text editor, and the order of the notes will be set and changed by the user.

### 3.Checkbook

The Checkbook page will be a virtual “wallet” or money tracking software. The main focus will be identifying the balance, charges per month, date of charges, types of charges, and the payee of the charge.

### 4.Calendar

The Calendar page will be constructed in the normal fashion as current web based calendar applications. However, this page will only display the work week, Monday thru Friday, with access to the weekend days, Saturday and Sunday, by the side of the applications window. The calendar will show events created by the user and information collected from the Checkbook and ToDo list.

### 5.Agenda

The Agenda page will take daily snippets of current and upcoming days from the calendar and display them to the user. The Agenda will be an Infinite scroll showing the days from the calendar.

### 6.Home Screen

The Home Screen will be a combination of the other pages. At the top of the page will be the current total from the checkbook page. Next, will be the current day's info card from the Agenda page. Afterwards the Calendar will show a 5 week day view of the upcoming days. Finally, part of the ToDo list will be on the bottom of the page.

## Use/Downloading

Currently this application is only in development and cannot be used. Please wait for the first milestone to be released.

## Technologies

I am using a standard HTML/CSS(SASS)/JavaScript/React stack to build this app. As I reach for more technologies I will update this form.
